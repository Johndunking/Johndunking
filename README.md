- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Johndunking, an ambitious full stack developer looking for a team to collaborate and grow with! As an education specialist I strive to learn something new from each day and every experience. Coming from a teaching background, I have alot of experience in working with teams and understand that in receiving criticism, suggestions or feedback it is essential to assume positive intent to foster the most effective collaboration. As a full stack developer I will always leverage my data analysis, communication and collaborative problem solving skills to best support the team!

I have a strong passion for programming and would value the oppurtunity to work on diverse and challenging projects. Currently, I enjoy utilizing frameworks like react and angular with packages like tailwind css, bootstrap and gsap to creatively solve problems and create modern designs for web apps.

As a lifelong learner with a creative and open mindset, my goal in programming is to continue learning new languages, frameworks and best practices in fullstack development!
